\description{
Pattern reconstruction

\details{
The functions randomizes the observed pattern by using pattern reconstruction
as described in Tscheschel & Stoyan (2006) and Wiegand & Moloney (2014). The
algorithm starts with a random reconstructed pattern, shifts a point to a new location and
keeps the change only, if the deviation between the observed and the reconstructed
pattern decreases. The pair correlation function and the nearest neighbour
distance function are used to describe the patterns. For large patterns
`comp_fast = TRUE` decreases the computational demand because no edge
correction is used and the pair correlation function is estimated based on Ripley's
K-function. For more information see \code{\link{estimate_pcf_fast}}.
