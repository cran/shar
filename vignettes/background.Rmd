Species-habitat associations are present if species are specialized to small-scale environmental conditions (Tilman & Pacala, 1993) and are more common within suitable habitats (Comita et al., 2007; Harms et al., 2001). Following, species-habitat associations show the importance of abiotic processes on the spatial patterning of plant populations (Garzon-Lopez et al., 2014).

There are mainly two methods that can be found in the literature to analyse such small-scale species-habitat associations, namely the gamma-test (Plotkin et al., 2000) and the torus-translation test (Harms et al., 2001). Both methods require data on the locations of plants (as `spatstat::ppp` point pattern) and on the environmental conditions (classified into discrete habitats as `raster::raster`). To show significance species-habitat associations, both methods randomize one of the components. Because the locations of plants as well as the habitats are most likely auto-correlated, the spatial structure must be kept while randomizing the data (Wiegand & Moloney, 2014).

All methods compare the abundance within a habitat between the observed data and the randomized null model data. If the count is below or above a pre-set threshold (e.g. the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles), negative or positive associations, respectively, are present.

### Gamma-test
The gamma-test (Plotkin et al. 2000) randomizes the data by fitting a point process model to the observed data and simulation n random point patterns using the fitted point process model. However, the method only works for point patterns that can be described by a theoretical point process model. To use this method in **shar** use `fit_point_process()`.

### Torus-translation-test
The torus-translation test (Harms et al. 2001) shifts the habitat map in all four cardinal directions around a torus. This is only possible for square rasters. To use this method in **shar** use `translate_raster()`.

### Randomized-habitats procedure
The randomze-habitats procedure (Harms et al. 2001) is also possible for non-square raster and randomizes the habitats using a random-walk algorithm. To use this method in **shar** use `randomize_raster()`.

### Pattern reconstruction
Pattern reconstruction (Tscheschel & Stoyan 2006) randomizes the point pattern using simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983). This allows to randomize also complex point patterns without a theoretical point process model. To use this method in **shar** use `reconstruct_pattern()`
